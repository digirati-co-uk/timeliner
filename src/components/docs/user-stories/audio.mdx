# A/V User stories
These user stories focus around the interactions with the audio on the timeline.

## As a user, I can control the playback of the audio so that I can move to any point in the timeline
**Acceptance Criteria**
* [ ] I can play the audio file
* [ ] I can pause the audio file
* [ ] I can scrub the audio file backwards
* [ ] I can scrub the audio file forwards
* [ ] I can skip to the next bubble point
* [ ] I can skip to the previous bubble point
* [ ] I can see the playhead moving accordingly along the timeline

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
  * AudioTransport
    * Load audio from the manifest
      * we assume the audio is preloaded and
    * controls playback state
  * Bubbles
    * handle timeline user interactions 
      * skip to time
      * drag current time indicator
    * handle individual bubble's user interactions
      * Skip to range
* Components
  * Bubbles
    * Indicates current time on the timeline under the bubbles
  * AudioTransport
    * display playback controls
        * play/pause button
        * previous range(bubble) button
        * previous next(bubble) button
        * skip five seconds ahead button
        * skip five seconds backwards button
    * Indicates current time in mm:ss (maybe for longer compositions hh:mm:ss)
* Data model
  * Bubbles
    * ranges:[IIIFRange]
    * selectedRange:IIIFRange
    * currentTime:Number(in milliseconds)
    * onRangeClicked(IIIFRange)
    * onTrackClicked()
  * AudioTransport
    * audioURI:string
    * isLoaded:boolean
    * currentTime:Number(in milliseconds)
    * audio:react-sound.Sound
    * onSkipForwardClicked()
    * onSkipBackwardClicked()
    * onPreviousRangeClicked()
    * onNextRangeClicked()

TODO: error handling? e.g. Audio doesn't load. Format doesn't supported.

TBC...    

**Q**: What is the difference between this scrub and the one described on top?

## As a user, I want to be able to hear the section of music relating to the bubble I have selected so that I can form my annotation. 
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] User can hear section of audio when a bubble is selected
* [ ] Audio snippet loops when getting to the end of the snippet

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * If a range(bubble) is selected, switches to looping mode 
* Components
  * Bubbles
   * onRangeClicked(IIIFRange)
* Data model
  * Bubbles
    * selectedRange:IIIFRange
**Q**: what triggers the deselect?
