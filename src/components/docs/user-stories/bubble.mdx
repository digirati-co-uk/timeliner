* [ ] I can see a single big bubble representing the top level hierarchy

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * Present user with an Import IIIF document from URL
    * Present user with an Import audio file from URL
    * Will fetch IIIF document once loaded, providing feedback to use
    * Will wrap audio file in "fake" manifest wrapper
    * Will pass the manifest json back to caller
    * Will create a default range if one does not exist
* Components
    * Audio Importer
        * IIIF Url field
        * Audio file field
        * Select/choose button
    * Loading Indicator
    * Primary Button
    * Bubble Display
        * Needs to be able to be fed in list of points (data model at the bottom of this page)
    * Single Bubble
        * Needs to be able to render semi-circle at specified height and width
    
## As a user, I can add bubbles to the timeline so that I can divide the timeline into sections
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] Clicking on existing bubbles generate 2 bubbles inside the bubble on the X-axis 
* [ ] When I finish adding the new bubbles, I am back where I started 

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * Button to add new time point
    * Will activate the scrubber at the bottom of the bubbles 
    * Clicking on the bottom scrubber will create a point
    * Calculate current time from X position of click
    * Splits parent range into 2 child ranges and adds them to the parent
    * Click same button to disable this editing mode.
    * Hit box of line is larger than line itself.
* Components
    * Timeline Scrubber
        * Knows the current time and runtime to calculate widths
        * Gets list of times to plot on line
        * Line background
        * Editing/not-editing state
        * Passes point list back to parent
    * Play head
    * Timeline Marker

## As a user I can change the size of the bubbles so they correspond to the right audio ranges
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] When I hover over an existing point, I can see that I can drag it
* [ ] When I drag the point, the bubble changes size accordingly

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * Dragging a point will use the X position to calculate a new time
    * Updating the point will pass the list of points to parent with modifications
    * List updates will be immutable, but shallow, copy on write
    * Updated point list will update bubble display
* Components
    * Timeline Scrubber
        * Drag events on the timeline marker will update their positions
        * Point list callback needed
    * Bubble Display
        * List of points displayed as bubbles need to be reactive to new points list
    * Single Bubble
        * Needs to be reactive to width changes

## As a user I want to be able to select multiple bubbles and group them into a logical grouping with another bubble around them
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] I can select multiple bubbles
* [ ] I can choose to group multiple bubbles, surrounding them in a new bubble

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * **Unknown**: interaction of selecting multiple bubbles (shift key?)
    * **Unknown**: where to display merge button
    * **Unknown**: When selecting more ranges, sometime the merging logic may not always be the same and sometimes bubbles may not be able to be merged.
* Components
    * Single Bubble
        * Need to be able to display active/inactive colours
        * Need click events to select bubbles
    * Merge button
        * Should only appear when 2 or more ranges are selected

## As a user, I want to be able to assign a different colour to a bubble to distinguish it from the rest.
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] User can see current colour of bubble
* [ ] User can change the colour of the select bubble
* [ ] User can select multiple bubbles and change the colour

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * Selecting colour from a preset range of colours
    * Will change the current bubbles colour
    * Bubbles will have default colours based on depth of range
    * Selecting multiple bubbles to change colour is allowed, outside of restrictions of merging
* Components
    * BubbleDisplay
        * Selecting single and multiple bubbles
    * Single Bubble
        * Configurable background colour
    * Swatch colour picker
        * Display configured set of colours to choose from
        * Selecting a range will show the current colour
        * Choosing different coloured ranges will show an unknown colour state
        * Choosing a colour will callback to parent


## As a user I want to be able to narrow down a section of the music to work on so that I can see the sections clearer
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] User can zoom into a section
* [ ] User can zoom out

**Technical details**
* Behaviours
    * Zoom in buttons and a reset view button
    * When zoomed in bubbles will scale in the X dimension, but not the Y so the height will stay the same
    * When zoomed in, user can drag the bubble display to move left and right (view box)
* Components
    * BubbleDisplay
        * Need concept of cropping for bubbles displayed
        * Could be fed subset of bubbles to display (perf?)
    * Single bubble
        * Scaling bubbles should not distort display
    * ZoomControls
        * Zoom in
        * Zoom out
        * Home

## As a user, I want to be able to hear the section of music relating to the bubble I have selected so that I can form my annotation.
**Acceptance criteria**
* [ ] User can hear section of audio when a bubble is selected
* [ ] Audio snippet loops when getting to the end of the snippet

**Technical details**
* [ todo, waiting for audio spec ]

## As I user I want to be able to remove bubbles 
**Acceptance Criteria**
* [ ] I should be able to select a single bubble to remove it
* [ ] I should be able to select multiple bubbles and remove them
* [ ] I should see the bubbles around the bubble I deleted resize to fit

**Dev tasks**
- [ todo, waiting on [outstanding questions](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/timeliner/issues/23) ]


## Technical details

* Primary Button
* Timeline Scrubber
* Play head
* Timeline marker

* Swatch colour picker

### Data model of points
Since we will be posting update events on points and a tree of points, I think it makes sense that the structure stays 
quite flat. Something like:
```js
const points = {
    root: {
        from: 0,
        to: 1000,
        children: ['bubble1', 'bubble4'], 
    },
    bubble1: {
        from: 0,
        to: 500,
        children: ['bubble2', 'bubble3'],
    },
    bubble2: {
        from: 0,
        to: 150,
    },
    bubble3: {
        from: 151,
        to: 500,
    },
    bubble4: {
        from: 500,
        to: 1000,
    },
};
```

This would allow the full tree of points to be resolved using something like:
```js
function mapPoint(points, pointId) {
  const point = points[pointId];
  if (point.children) {
    return {...point, children: point.children.map(childId => mapPoint(points, childId)) }
  }
  return point;
}
const fullPoints = mapPoint(points, 'root');

// or in a render

function RenderPoint({ points, pointId = 'root' }) {
  const point = points[pointId];
  return (
    <Point {...point}>
      {point.children 
        ? point.children.map(childId => (
          <RenderPoint points={points} pointId={childId} key={childId} />
        ))
        : null
      }
    </Point>
  );
}
```

While still allowing the points to be updated:
```js
function editPoint(points, pointId, from, to) {
  return {
    ...points,
    [pointId]: {...points[pointId], from, to }
  };
}

const newPoints = editPoint(points, 'root', 0, 1500);
```

The full state of a point, based on the current requirements:
```js
const point = {
  id: 'id-1',
  from: 0,
  to: 1000,
  children: ['id-3', 'id-2'],
  label: 'some label',
  summary: 'some summary',
  isSelected: false,
  colour: '#ff0000',
};
```
