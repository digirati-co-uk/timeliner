The work alternates between two main ideas (A B A B A B + Coda). The first of these ideas always returns in the tonic with only slight modifications, (suggesting a rondo theme), while the second idea is developmental, moving through several keys. One might interpret the organization of this Nocturne as a rondo, or alternatively as strophic (A A' A'' Coda), in which each strophe consists of two parts (A and B)."]},"items":[{"id":"http://digirati.com/iiif/v3/temporary/canvas/c1","type":"Canvas","label":{"en":["Untitled Item"]},"items":[{"id":"http://digirati.com/iiif/v3/temporary/list/c1-ap","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"http://digirati.com/iiif/v3/temporary/annot/c1-1","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","label":{"en":["Untitled audio"]},"body":{"id":"http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/~jwd/Chopin_nocturne.mp3","type":"Audio","duration":330.73632653061225,"format":"audio/mp3"},"target":"http://digirati.com/iiif/v3/temporary/canvas/c"}]}]}],"structures":[{"id":"id-1539276565248","type":"Range","label":{"en":["B"]},"summary":{"en":["The B theme features continuous \"double-stops\" (often parallel thirds and sixths) rather than a single melodic line.
